/**
  * Some type of properties are not inherited by default and some elements do
  * not inherit some properties. This is to make sure to inherit properties from
  * the global scope.
  * 1. The default value of line height is normal. Chrome, Safari and Firefox
  *    use 'normal' as the default for several elements. This value is computed
  *    from font metrics. To ensure a consistent line height all elements
  *    inherit the line height from html.
  * 2. In a visual design to be built, the spacings of paragraphs, headings and
  *    other elements are always custom and not the browser  default. Resetting
  *    this makes creating a new vertical rhythm easier. It also easily shows
  *    what elements don't have a vertical rhythm yet.

  * 1. Improve readability with font smoothing.

  * 3. Apply a natural box layout model to all elements, but allowing
  *    components to change.
